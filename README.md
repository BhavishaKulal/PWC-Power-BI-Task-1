# PWC-Power BI Virtual work experience-Call Center Dashboard

 The dashboard is designed to provide with a comprehensive, real-time view of key performance indicators (KPIs) within the call center. This interactive dashboard combines critical metrics, giving management the ability to monitor customer satisfaction, agent performance, and overall operational efficiency at a glance.

 # Problem Statement
 To create a dashboard that reflects all relevant Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and metrics in the dataset. 
Possible KPIs include:
* Overall customer satisfaction
* Overall calls answered/abandoned
* Calls by time
* Average speed of answer
* Agentâ€™s performance quadrant -> average handle time (talk duration) vs calls answered

**Data Source**

The dataset used for this task was presented by [Pwc](https://www.pwc.com) and the call centre trends dataset:

- **Dataset**: [Call Centre Trends](calldata.xlsx)

## Insights 
**1. Overall Resolution Rate**:
Out of all calls, only 27.08% (1,350) were resolved, while 72.92% (3,650) were not. This suggests a potential area for improvement in resolving customer issues effectively.
**2. Call Answering Performance**:
The majority of calls (81.08%) were answered (4,050 calls), while 18.92% (945 calls) were not answered. The high number of unanswered calls could indicate a resource or efficiency issue within the call center.
**3. Monthly Call Trends**:
The call answering rate hovers around 80% each month, with a slight dip in some periods. Monitoring these monthly variations could help identify when call center support is most needed and if staffing adjustments are required.
**4. Agent Performance**:
Agents vary in their call handling and resolution rates
These statistics show that while some agents handle more calls, their satisfaction scores vary, suggesting room for training or process improvements.
**5. Average Satisfaction Score**:
The overall average satisfaction rating is 3.40 out of 5, indicating moderate customer satisfaction. Identifying factors contributing to lower satisfaction could guide initiatives for enhancing the customer experience.
**6. Focus on Specific Agents**:
Some agents, like Joe, handle a high volume of calls but have lower satisfaction ratings. In contrast, others, such as Becky, have a slightly higher resolution rate and a better satisfaction score. This comparison could help in determining training needs for specific agents.
**7. Resolution Rate by Agents**:
Despite having a lower average satisfaction, Joe answers more calls than others, indicating efficiency but possibly at the cost of resolution quality.
Agents like Diane and Greg have higher satisfaction scores (above 3.4), suggesting their call-handling approach may be more customer-centric.
**8. Next Steps for Improvement**:
Training Focus: Agents with lower satisfaction ratings may benefit from targeted training to improve their customer interaction skills.
Staffing Adjustments: With a noticeable percentage of unanswered calls, consider optimizing staffing during peak hours.
Monitoring: Continue monitoring call resolution rates and satisfaction scores to identify trends and areas for further improvement.
By focusing on these insights, the call center can enhance overall efficiency, customer satisfaction
